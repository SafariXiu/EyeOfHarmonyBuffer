NameVendingMachines=Vending Machines
Tooltip_VendingMachines_MachineType=Vending Machines
Tooltip_VendingMachines_Controller=Controller block for the Vending Machines
Tooltip_VendingMachines_00=A large trade machine, Vending Machines, Place the marked item into the machine's main block slot to set it as the machine's output item.
Tooltip_VendingMachines_01=When powered by a wireless EU Net, it supports parallel multi-recipe processing with a fixed working time of 6.4 seconds.
Tooltip_VendingMachines_02=Put the desired output item into the machine's main block. Any input item will produce the desired output item!
Tooltip_VendingMachines_03=The machine has a default of int parallel processing, a fixed working time of 6.4 seconds, and consumes no power.
NameWindTurbine=Large Wind Turbine
Tooltip_WindTurbine_MachineType=Wind Turbine
Tooltip_WindTurbine_Controller=Controller block for the Large Wind Turbine
Tooltip_WindTurbine_00=A large wind turbine that starts operating once the rotor is placed into the controller.
Tooltip_WindTurbine_01=The higher the grade of the rotor, the more power it generates.
Tooltip_WindTurbine_02=The power generation formula is: UHV * Wind Factor * Rotor Level.The Wind Factor refreshes every 30 seconds and ranges from 0.5 to 1.5.
Tooltip_WindTurbine_03=Clean energy! May your skies remain pollution-free!
StructureInfo_WindTurbine_00=The rotor material is classified as follows:
StructureInfo_WindTurbine_01=Wood-Level 1-1x
StructureInfo_WindTurbine_02=Iron-Level 2-4x
StructureInfo_WindTurbine_03=Steel-Level 2-8x

StructureInfo_WindTurbine_08=Iridium-Level 8-256x
StructureInfo_WindTurbine_09=They are terrifyingly powerful!
NameSolarEnergyArray=Solar Energy Array
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_MachineType=Solar Energy Array
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_Controller=Controller block for the Solar Energy Array
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_00=A large solar panel, better than the smaller one!
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_01=It works at all times, don't ask why! This is a highly advanced machine!
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_02=The power generation formula is MAX * MAX.
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_03=Clean energy! May your skies remain pollution-free!
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_04=Place the Astral Array Fabricator in the Controller Block to activate Wireless Mode.
Tooltip_SolarEnergyArray_05=After activating Wireless Mode, Dynamo Hatches are no longer needed.
NameSubstanceReshapingDevice=Substance Reshaping Device
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_MachineType=Substance Reshaping Device
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_Controller=Controller block for the Substance Reshaping Device
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_00=Void begets all things, and chaos forges gods. All matter can be reshaped, but great power cannot be defied.
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_01=The laws of the universe are both a cage and a shackle. All things follow the path of entropy—life will inevitably decay, stars will burn out, and dust will return to dust. But we refuse to accept this fate.
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_02=They are nameless entities, echoes from beyond reality, remnants we brought back from the unknown when we tampered with the laws of the universe.
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_03=We are the creators of stars, the manipulators of reality, and the ultimate masters of gravity!
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_04=Some particles exhibit arrangements that defy known physical rules, some substances exist in ways that violate the laws of thermodynamics.
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_05=and some creations… vanish the moment we attempt to document them, as if they never existed at all.
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_06=The machine supports cross-recipe parallel processing!
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_07=Supports up to 10 recipes running simultaneously! The optimal ratio for each recipe is 64*10!
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_08=If any recipe exceeds 64 units in operation, it will cause a decrease in total parallel efficiency!
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_09=But remember this—creators are also destroyers.
Tooltip_SubstanceReshapingDevice_10="When the gods fall silent, mortals may seize the mantle of power. But remember, the mantle was never truly ours to claim."
